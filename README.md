# BTree-ADMS
### Assignment for the course CSD307: Advanced Data Management System

This is a repository for the lab assignment #1, which consists of implementation of a B-Tree, for the course CSD307, Advanced Data Management Systems, Shiv Nadar University. The B-Tree algorithm has been implemented in Java v1.7.

This algorithm is implemented on the __disk__, that is *each node is stored as a <b>serialized</b> object file in the disk*. At a time the there are atmost only <b>3</b> nodes loaded into the Memory.

This implementation has been successfully tested for up to 1000000 elements. 

Inputs  : Choice of manual entry or randomized number insertion into the tree.
Outputs : Results of Traversal, Search.
